  lyrics: `We're talking away...

I don't know what
I'm to say...I'll say it anyway

Today's another day to find you
Shying away!

I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me!
Take me on!

I'll be gone
In a day or two

-

So needless to say...

I'm odds and ends
But, I'll be stumbling away

Slowly learning that life is OK
Say after me

It's no better to be safe than sorry...

Take on me!
Take me on!

I'll be gone
In a day or two

In a day or two!

-

Things that you say

Is it life or
Just to play my worries away

You're all the things I can't remember...

You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me!
Take me on!

I'll be gone
In a day or two

Take on me!
Take me on!

I'll be gone
In a day or two`,
