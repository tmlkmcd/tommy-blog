  lyrics: `🎷🎺

Hey, Jack! I know what you're thinking...

That now's as good as any to start drinking

(Hey, Scottie!) Yeah?
(What's it gonna be?)

A gin and tonic sounds mighty, mighty good to me!

Man, I know, I've gotta go
It's the same thing every time

But I don't think another drink's gonna
Make me lose my mind... 

So I'll think about my next drink

And it's you & me & the bottle makes 3 tonight!

🎵🎷🎺🎶

Well, I know this cat named Mo
and he wanders to and fro

He's in my favorite watering hole

I says, "Hey, Mo, how you doing,
Where have you been?"

He says, "I've been fine with my
Whiskey, wine and gin!"

Oh man, I know, I gotta go
It's the same thing every time

But I don't think another drink's gonna
Make me lose my mind...

So I'll think about my next drink

And it's you & me & the bottle makes 3 tonight!

Hey, Jack, I know what you're thinking...

That now's as good as any to start drinking

(Hey, Scottie!) Yeah?
(What's it gonna be?)

A gin and tonic sounds mighty, mighty good to me!

Man, I know, I've gotta go
It's the same thing every time

But I don't think another drink's gonna
Make me lose my mind... 

So I'll think about my next drink

And it's you & me & the bottle makes 3 tonight!

And it's you & me & the bottle makes 3 tonight 🍸

And it's you & me & the bottle makes 3...
