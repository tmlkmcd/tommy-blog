  lyrics: `I got chills...they're multiplying

And I'm losing control

'Cause the power you're supplying...
It's electrifying!

You better shape up
'Cause I need a man

And my heart is set on you!

You better shape up
You better understand

To my heart I must be true
Nothin' left, nothin' left for me to do...

You're the one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

The one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

The one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh

The one I need
Oh, yes, indeed

If you're filled with affection...

You're too shy to convey

Meditate in my direction
Feel your way

I better shape up

'Cause you need a man
(I need a man)

Who can keep me satisfied

I better shape up!

If I'm gonna prove
(You better prove)

That my faith is justified
(Are you sure?)
Yes, I'm sure down deep inside!

You're the one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

The one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

The one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh

The one I need
Oh, yes, indeed

You're the one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

The one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

The one that I want!
Ooh ooh, ooh

The one I need
Oh, yes, indeed, ooh, ooh

You're the one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

The one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, honey

The one that I want!
Ooh, ooh, ooh

The one I need
Oh, yes, indeed

You're the one that I want!`,
