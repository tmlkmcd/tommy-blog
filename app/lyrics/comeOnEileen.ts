  lyrics: `ðŸŽº Come on Eileen ðŸŽº

Poor old Johnny Ray

Sounded sad upon the radio
He moved a million hearts in mono

Our mothers used to sing along
Who'd blame them?

You're grown (you're grown up)
So grown (so grown up)

Now I must say more than ever

Toora, loora, toora, loorye, aye!

And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear, well, he means

At this moment...
You mean everything

You in that dress
Oh, my thoughts, I confessed

Verge on dirty
Ah, come on Eileen

ðŸŽº Come on Eileen ðŸŽº

These people round here

Wear beaten down eyes
Sun in smoke dried faces
Resigned to what their fate is

But not us (no, never)
No, not us (no, never)

We are far too young and clever (remember!)

Toora, loora, toora, loorye, aye!
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever

Toora, loora, toora, loorye, aye!
Eileen, I'll hum this tune forever...

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear, well, he means

Ah, come on let's...
...

That pretty red dress
Oh, Eileen tell him yes

Oh, come on let's...
Ah, come on Eileen

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear, well, he means

At this moment, you mean everything

Come on Eileen, tooloorye, aye
Come on Eileen, tooloorye, aye

Toora, toora tooloorye, oh, Eileen...

I said, come on Eileen!
Oh, come on Eileen!

We are far too young and clever
And things won't ever change

And I say, toora, loora, toora loorye, aye!

Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear, well, he means
At this moment, you mean everything to me

Oh, to me
Oh, Eileen
You mean everything...`,
