  lyrics: `You say...

The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay

You cry...
In your tea, which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad? 😭

Remember, we made an arrangement when you went away
Now, you're making me mad!

Remember, despite our estrangement,
I'm your man...

You'll be back! Soon, you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me

You'll be back! Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well

Oceans rise! Empires fall...
We have seen each other through it all

And when push...
Comes to shove...

I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love! 😍

Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da

Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya

You say our love is draining,
and you can't go on!

You'll be the one complainin'
when I am gone...

And no, don't change the subject!

'Cause you're my favorite subject!!

My sweet, submissive subject...
My loyal, royal subject... 👑

Forever!
...and ever...
...and ever and ever and ever...

You'll be back!
Like before

I will fight the fight and win the war!

For your love! For your praise...

And I'll love you 'til my dying days!

When you're gone, I'll go mad!
So don't throw away this thing we had 😢

'Cause when push comes to shove

I will kill your friends and family...
...to remind you of my love!

Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da

Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da

Da-da, dat...
...everybody! 😬

Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da

Da-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da
Da-da-da, dat, da-ya-da-ah...`,
