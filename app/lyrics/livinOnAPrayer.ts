  lyrics: `ðŸ˜¬TommyðŸ˜¬ used to work on the docks

Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck, it's tough...

...so tough

Gina works the diner all day

working for her man
She brings home her pay, for love...

...Mmm, for love

She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got

It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not

We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer!

Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer!

ðŸ˜¬TommyðŸ˜¬'s got his six string in hock

Now he's holding in
When he used to make it talk so tough, ooh...

...it's tough

Gina dreams of running away

When she cries in the night,
Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay...

...someday"

We've gotta hold on to what we've got

It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not

We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer!

Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer!

Livin' on a prayer...

ðŸŽ¸

Oh, we've gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got!

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer!

Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer!

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer!

Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa oh, livin' on a prayer!

Livin' on a prayer...`,
