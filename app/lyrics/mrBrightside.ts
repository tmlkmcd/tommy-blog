  lyrics: `Comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all

It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss

Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag

Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his...

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go

And I just can't look, it's killing me

They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies

Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay

Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes

'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside

ðŸŽµ

I'm comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all

It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
(It was only a kiss...) It was only a kiss!

Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's havin' a smoke and she's taking a drag

Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his...

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go

'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me

They're taking control

Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies

Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay

Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes

'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I never...

I never...!

I never!!

I never...`,
