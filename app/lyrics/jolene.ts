  lyrics: `Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene...

I'm begging of you, please don't take my man

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair

Ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain

I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep

From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man

You don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

ðŸŽºðŸŽ·

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

Oh, I'm begging of you, please don't take my man

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

Please don't take him just because you can
Oh, please don't take him even though you can

Oh, please don't take him even though you can...`,
