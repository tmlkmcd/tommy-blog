  lyrics: `I want to be the very best
Like no one ever was

To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide

Teach Pok√©mon to understand
The power that's inside

(Pok√©mon! Gotta catch 'em all)
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny

(Pok√©mon!)
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

(Pok√©mon! Gotta catch 'em all)
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I'll teach you
POK√âMON...

(Gotta catch 'em all)
Gotta catch 'em all! üò¨

Every challenge along the way
With courage, I will face

I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team

Arm in arm, we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

(Pok√©mon! Gotta catch 'em all)
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny

(Pok√©mon!)
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

(Pok√©mon! Gotta catch 'em all)
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I'll teach you
POK√âMON...

(Gotta catch 'em all)
Gotta catch 'em all

üé∏üéπ

(Pok√©mon! Gotta catch 'em all)
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny

(Pok√©mon!)
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend

(Pok√©mon! Gotta catch 'em all)
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I'll teach you
POK√âMON...

(Gotta catch 'em all)
GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL!`,
